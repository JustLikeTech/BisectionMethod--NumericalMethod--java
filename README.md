# Bisection Method with GUI (Java Swing)

This project is a **Java Swing application** that implements the **Bisection Method** to find the root of a mathematical function.  
It provides a graphical interface for input, displays iteration results in a table, and allows saving the results into a `.txt` file.  

---

## Features
- GUI-based input for:
  - Interval values (**a** and **b**)
  - Tolerance (**Îµ**)
  - Maximum iteration count
- Displays iteration process in a table:
  - Iteration number
  - Values of `a`, `b`, `xr`
  - Function evaluations `f(a)`, `f(b)`
- Validation for invalid intervals.
- Saves results to a text file (`Hasil_Bisection.txt`).
- Clean and responsive user interface (Java Swing).

## Function Used
The program solves the root of:

\[
f(x) = e^{-x} - x
\]
